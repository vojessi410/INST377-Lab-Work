        <h1>Jessica Vo Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
        <p>First, the basics.</p>

        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Nodes.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Learn front-end web design</li>
            <li>Learn new programming languages</li>
            <li>Learn popular web dev frameworks</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

        <h3>Empty Elements</h3>

        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>

        <p>Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

Images 
Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
